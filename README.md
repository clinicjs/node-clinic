An Open Source Node.js performance profiling suite originally developed by [NearForm][].

Demo and detailed documentation: https://clinicjs.org/

## Install

```
npm install -g clinic
```

## Getting started

As a first step, run the `clinic doctor`:

`clinic doctor -- node server.js`

Then benchmark your server with `wrk` or `autocannon`:

```
wrk http://localhost:3000
autocannon http://localhost:3000
```

If you want to run autocannon as soon as your server starts listening you can
use the `--autocannon` option using [subarg][] syntax.

```sh
clinic doctor --autocannon [ / --method POST ] -- node server.js
```

Other benchmarking tools like wrk can be started in a similar way using the `--on-port` flag

```sh
# $PORT is the port the server is listening on
clinic doctor --on-port 'wrk http://localhost:$PORT' -- node server.js
```

Finally shut down your server (Ctrl+C). Once the server process has shutdown
`clinic doctor` will analyse the collected data and detect what type of issue
you are having. Based on the issue type, it will provide a recommendation for
you.

For example, to debug I/O issues, use `clinic bubbleprof`:

```
clinic bubbleprof -- node server.js
```

Then benchmark your server again, just like you did with `clinic doctor`.

Note that when looking at the CPU graph you might notice that it doesn't
necessarily go from 0-100 but might go from 0-200 or higher. This is because the
percentage reflects the total amount of CPU cores your computer has. Node.js
itself uses more than one thread behind the scene even though JavaScript is
single threaded. V8 (The JavaScript engine) runs the garbage collector and some
optimizations on background threads. With worker threads, the CPU will also
utilize more than 100%. The visible percentage is always the combination of all
these factors together.

## Supported Node.js versions

Clinic.js relies heavily on Node.js core instrumentation available in later versions.
Currently the supported Node.js versions are `>= 10.12.0`.
