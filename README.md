## Install

```
npm install -g clinic
```

## Getting started

As a first step, run the <code>clinic doctor</code>:

<code>clinic doctor -- node server.js</code>

Then benchmark your server with <code>wrk</code> or <code>autocannon</code>:

```
wrk http://localhost:3000
autocannon http://localhost:3000
```

If you want to run autocannon or wrk as soon as your server starts listening you can
use the `--on-port` option

```sh
# $PORT is the port the server is listening on
clinic doctor --on-port 'autocannon http://localhost:$PORT' -- node server.js
```

Finally shut down your server (Ctrl+C). Once the server process has shutdown
<code>clinic doctor</code> will analyse the collected data and detect what type of issue
you are having. Based on the issue type, it will provide a recommendation for
you.

For example, to debug I/O issues, use <code>clinic bubbleprof</code>:

```
clinic bubbleprof -- node server.js
```

Then benchmark your server again, just like you did with <code>clinic doctor</code>.

## Supported Node.js versions

Clinic relies heavily on Node.js core instrumentation available in later versions.
Currently the supported Node.js versions are `^10.0.0` and `^8.9.4`.
