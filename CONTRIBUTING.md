# Welcome to Clinic.js!

Please take a second to read over this before opening an issue. Providing complete information upfront will help us address any issue (and ship new features!) faster.

We greatly appreciate bug fixes, documentation improvements and new features, however when contributing a new major feature, it is a good idea to idea to first open an issue, to make sure the feature it fits with the goal of the project, so we don't waste your or our time.

## Code of Conduct

The Clinic.js project has a [Code of Conduct][CoC] that all contributors are
expected to follow.

## Bug Reports

A perfect bug report would have the following:

1. Summary of the issue you are experiencing.
2. Details on what versions of node and Clinic.js you have (`node -v` and `clinic -v`).
3. A simple repeatable test case for us to run. Please try to run through it 2-3 times to ensure it is completely repeatable.

We would like to avoid issues that require a follow up questions to identify the bug. These follow ups are difficult to do unless we have a repeatable test case.

In addition, it is helpful if you upload your Clinic.js data to help us diagnose your issues.
Use the `clinic upload` tool to do this:

```
clinic upload 10000.clinic-doctor
```

After the upload has finished, add the printed upload id to your issue.

## For Developers

All contributions should fit the [standard](https://github.com/standard/standard) linter, and pass the tests.
You can test this by running:

```
npm test
```

In addition, make sure to add tests for any new features.
You can test the test coverage by running:

```
npm run ci-cov
```

## For Collaborators

Make sure to get a `:thumbsup:`, `+1` or `LGTM` from another collaborator before merging a PR. If you aren't sure if a release should happen, open an issue.

Release process:

- `npm test`
- `npm version <major|minor|patch>`
- `git push && git push --tags`
- `npm publish`

## Licensing and Certification

While the Clinic.js project as a whole is distributed under the GPL 3.0
license, all contributions to the Clinic.js project are submitted *to* the

while ensuring that your rights to your contributions do not change.

The Clinic.js project uses a Contribution Certification that is derived from
the [Developer Certificate of Origin][DCO]. It is important to note that the
Contribution Certification *is not the same as the standard DCO* and we do not
use the term "DCO" or "Developer Certificate of Origin" to describe it to avoid
confusion. Nevertheless, the intent and purpose is effectively the same.

Every contributor agrees to the Contribution Certification by including a
`Signed-off-by` statement within each commit. The statement *must* include
the contributor's real full name and email address.

```
Signed-off-by: J. Random User <j.random.user@example.com>
```
