  To help us improve and debug <code>clinic</code> run <code>clinic upload</code> to upload
  data generated by Clinic.js to the cloud

  To upload data, you have to log in to the Clinic.js Upload server.
  Running <code>clinic upload</code> will open a browser window to handle the
  authentication. In a programmatic environment, use the <code>CLINIC_JWT</code>
  environment variable instead (see below).

  Run <code>clinic upload</code> to upload doctor data

    <code>clinic upload 13242.clinic-doctor</code>

  Or to upload bubbleprof data

    <code>clinic upload 13242.clinic-bubbleprof</code>

  Replace 13242 with your pid.

  If your profile contains potentially sensitive data, you can upload it
  privately to your account using <code>--private</code>.

    <code>clinic upload --private 13242.clinic-flame</code>
